## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- UI verse for loading effect (https://uiverse.io/)


### What I learned

Being a long time writing vanilaJS i found writing this challenge a little bit tricky reactJS has been my thing, easy to use useState() to accomplish this but i had to compromise. 

- learnt dom manipulation
- input onChange events
- email REGEX validation
- conditional rendering based on mode and state
- whitespaces removal in input field using the .trim()

### Amazing part
The most amazing part was making the input field show error immediately a user starts typing untill the email is in correct format
